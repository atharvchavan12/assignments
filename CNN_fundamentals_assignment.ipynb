       "'\\nConvolutional Layers in a CNN\\nA convolutional layer is the fundamental building block of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Its primary purpose is to automatically extract and learn features from the input data (usually images). This layer applies convolutional filters (kernels) to the input, which allows the network to detect various patterns, like edges, textures, and more complex structures as it goes deeper. These filters slide over the input data and generate a feature map that highlights specific features detected by the filter.\\n________________________________________\\nConcept of Filters (Kernels) in CNNs\\n•\\tFilter (Kernel): A filter (or kernel) is a small matrix of learnable parameters (weights) that is applied to the input data through a sliding window mechanism. The filter is smaller in size compared to the input image (e.g., a 3x3 filter applied to a 32x32 image).\\n•\\tConvolution Operation: The convolution operation involves sliding the filter over the input image (or feature map) and calculating a dot product between the filter and the corresponding region of the image. This dot product generates a single value, which becomes part of the output feature map.\\no\\tMathematical operation: For each position where the filter is applied, the weighted sum of pixel values in the corresponding region of the input is computed: (I∗K)(i,j)=∑m∑nI(i+m,j+n)⋅K(m,n)(I \\x07st K)(i,j) = \\\\sum_m \\\\sum_n I(i+m, j+n) \\\\cdot K(m, n)(I∗K)(i,j)=m∑n∑I(i+m,j+n)⋅K(m,n) Where III is the input, KKK is the filter (kernel), and (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) denotes the top-left corner of the region where the filter is currently applied.\\n•\\tMultiple Filters: In practice, multiple filters are used in each convolutional layer, and each one detects different features from the input image. These filters are trained during the learning process, and their weights are adjusted to capture meaningful features such as edges, textures, or higher-level objects.\\n•\\tOutput: The result of applying a filter to the input image is a feature map, which highlights the regions where the corresponding features (e.g., edges) are present.\\n________________________________________\\nPadding in Convolutional Layers\\nPadding refers to the addition of extra pixels (usually zeros) around the edges of the input image before applying the convolution operation.
